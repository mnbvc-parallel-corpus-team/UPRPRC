# UPRPRC: Unified Pipeline for Reproducing Parallel Resources - A Comprehensive Corpus from the United Nations

In the digital era, the fidelity and accessibility of multilingual data sets are paramount for advancing machine translation (MT) and natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the United Nations Parallel Corpus, a sophisticated iteration that not only extends the breadth of data but also incorporates the entirety of the pipeline required to transform raw UN data into a structured, parallel corpus. The corpus is comprised of documents sourced from the United Nations Digital Library (UNDL), ranging from the years 2000 to 2023, and has been designed to be immediately deployable for MT systems. It introduces a complete end-to-end solutionâ€”from data acquisition through web scraping to the alignment of texts and beyond. We address the obsolescence of previous data access methods by providing a novel pipeline that includes a minimalistic, single-machine runnable example and supplementary, optional distributed computing steps to minimize temporal costs. Our work builds upon and extends previous efforts in the field, leveraging recent advancements in text alignment tools. The corpus is presented with three levels of granularity and comes with a robust set of parallel texts that are readily accessible under the MIT License. This corpus not only facilitates the development of MT systems but also serves as a resource for linguists and researchers looking to explore the nuances of multilingual documentation within the United Nations framework.
